      "From a whisper to a scream, from pure country twang to serious rock and roll—even jazz—there are few guitars as outright versatile as a Telecaster. Respecting that long and storied heritage, while enhancing the instrument with the kinds of contemporary innovations that appeal to both casual and professional players, the Fender Player Series Telecaster puts a modern edge on the authentic Tele tone and vibe. Starting with a classic solid alder body loaded with Fender's Player Series Alnico V single-coil Tele pickups, the Player Series Tele adds a satin-finish Modern-C profile neck with a smooth, fast 9.5\"-radius fingerboard and 22 medium-jumbo frets for clean, easy bending and expanded range. The thru-body-strung, six-saddle bridge provides precise intonation and the steel saddles add some extra bite to the Tele's traditional twang. A true workhorse for virtually every musical genre, The Player Telecaster may be the guitar you'll play for the rest of your life, no matter how large your collection may grow.",

After nearly a century at the helm, and as the quintessential workhorse of music legends like Hank Williams, The Beatles, Johnny Cash, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, and so many more, Martin\'s legendary D-28 has been lovingly and artfully enhanced. \n\n“The post WWII D-28 had a slightly different look than its predecessor and became the centerpiece of the folk and folk rock movements at their pinnacle in the 1950s and 1960s." says Chris Martin, Chairman and CEO of Martin Guitar, "We have extracted the finest features from the D-28 of both my grandfather’s and my father’s respective eras.”\n\nThe 2017 D-28 blends the rich history of the guitar with Martin’s newest and most heralded innovations. The 184-year-old guitar maker has combined vintage appointments, including open gear tuners, an aged toner top, antique white accents, and a faux tortoise pickguard with a special neck profile to give D-28 enthusiasts a modern feel and comfortable playing experience. Martin has also added forward-shifted bracing to allow greater vibration of the top. ',

      'Experience the peerless Strat style of Slowhand himself with the Eric Clapton Stratocaster, one of our most acclaimed and enduring artist signature models. With classic design and special features that give it exceptional tonal versatility and effortless feel worthy of one of the world’s greatest names in rock and blues, it puts pure Clapton Stratocaster tone and feel straight into your hands.\n\nSoft "V" Neck Profile\nThe "soft V" neck profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) on the Eric Clapton Stratocaster has a distinctly comfortable fretting-hand feel that takes the more pronounced sharpness of a ’50s "V" profile and "softens" it into a somewhat more rounded shape. Ideal for players with larger hands whose thumb extends over the edge of the fingerboard.\n\nTBX Tone Control\nThe first tone control knob operates this guitar’s TBX (Treble Bass Expander) tone circuitry. The knob has a detent at the center position (5) and works like a normal tone control from zero to the detent. Turning the knob clockwise from the detent adds presence and brightness; turning it counterclockwise from the detent rolls off high frequencies.\n\nActive Mid Boost\nThe second tone control knob functions as an active mid-boost control. Turning it clockwise boosts mid and bass frequencies while decreasing treble frequencies.\n\nBlocked Tremolo\nThe Eric Clapton Stratocaster comes with an easily removable wood block installed between the tremolo block and tremolo cavity wall to keep it from moving, as specified by the great guitarist himself.\n\nUrethane Finish\nUrethane guitar body finishes are especially strong and durable, and will hold colors with great vividness, sheen and clarity for extraordinarily long periods.\n\n9.5 in. Fingerboard Radius\nThe fingerboard radius is an important spec that describes the amount of curvature across the width of the fingerboard. This instrument’s modern 9.5" fingerboard radius is slightly more flattened than a vintage-style radius, but still with enough arc to provide a natural and notably comfortable fretting-hand feel, and to make bending notes easier.',

      "Taylor's Master Guitar Designer, Andy Powers conceived the Builder's Edition to combine Old World aesthetic qualities with the latest Taylor innovations. This version makes a change from to the ground-breaking spruce-top K14ce and features a solid koa top with solid koa back and sides. Words fail to adequately convey what might be referred to in Hawaiian as the nani ko-kı- (supremely beautiful) appearance of Taylor's Hawaiian koa guitars, especially those featuring an all-koa body. Taylor celebrates that beauty with an all-wood appointment scheme. A hand-sprayed shaded edgeburst enhances koa’s rich blend of color, figure and grain structure, adding a tasteful aura.\n\nThe Builder's Edition is essentially Andy's \"Director's Cut\" edition with additional playing features and a distinct visual aesthetic. Exclusive to the Builder's Edition: beveled armrest and beveled cutaway with neck heel contouring, \"Curve Wing\" bridge, \"Silent\" satin finish with Kona burst, inlaid purfling body edge treatment, paua fingerboard/peghead inlays and rosette, paua edge trim (top and back), premium Gotoh tuners with 21:1 ratio and Expression System 2 electronics. This instrument ships in a Taylor deluxe hardshell case for optimal fit and protection.\n\nBody Shape\nA Taylor original, the Grand Auditorium helped establish the Taylor acoustic sound. The popular body style makes for a versatile guitar that yields ample volume in response to light fingerpicking, and reacts to medium strumming and flatpicking with a clear, balanced sound across the tonal spectrum. If you want a great all-purpose guitar, the GA is an excellent choice.\n\nTone Wood Pairing\nA guitar's top is the primary filter and distributor of vibrating string energy through the guitar, which means it has a huge impact on its sound. Koa is a fairly dense tropical hardwood with a strong midrange focus similar to mahogany, with a bit of extra top-end brightness and chime. The more koa is played and has a chance to open up - especially when the back and sides are also solid koa - it promises to grow warmer, sweeter, and even more inspiring.\n\nElectronics\nTaylor's ES2 is a revolutionary pickup design that delivers the latest in Taylor’s ongoing innovation in acoustic guitar amplification. The heart of the Expression System 2 is Taylor’s patented behind-the-saddle pickup, which features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors. Because the pickup doesn't sit under the saddle, the bottom of the saddle comes in full contact with the bridge, allowing all the nuance of the guitar's tone to come through clearly whether playing acousticly or plugged-in. The location of the sensors enables a more dynamic range of acoustic sound to be captured than ever before while playing plugged-in. Together with Taylor’s custom-designed “professional audio”-grade preamp, this system produces exceptional amplified tone and responsiveness. On stage through a PA, plugged into your favorite acoustic amplifier, or direct into recording software, the Expression System 2 faithfully conveys the voice of your Taylor guitar. The Taylor Expression System 2 operates through a proprietary 9-volt battery compartment and easy-to-use volume, and active bass and treble controls.\n\nOther Features\nTaylor's V-Class bracing is a fundamental innovation in acoustic guitar design. It marks an important evolution beyond traditional X-bracing, introducing an entirely new platform for acoustic performance. It is essentially an \"engine\" that optimizes the response of an acoustic guitar in three key ways: by boosting volume, sustain, and by largely resolving the intonation issues that have long plagued acoustic guitars. V-Class bracing creates purer, more orderly notes that don't cancel each other out or sound \"off\". They have clearer, more consistent response, and the whole fretboard is brought into greater sonic alignment for a more musical playing/listening experience. Guitars with V-Class bracing are easier to tune; the pitch sounds purer and more solid, and electronic tuners can more easily locate notes for quick, precise tuning. Other benefits: harmonics ring more uniformly down the neck, notes are louder with more projection and sustain, and notes are more consistent, i.e., upper register notes don't get choked out or swallowed. Fewer \"sour\" sonic qualities exist with chords; a more agreeable relationship is created between notes as they ripen, bloom and decay.",

That mix of portability and musicality has proven to be a winning combination that fits into so many scenarios in life, from the couch to the campfire to the concert hall. It's not too big. It's not too precious. It's not too expensive. That broad-based accessibility has given it a resounding universal appeal, not to mention a built-in fun factor. The shorter 23-1/2 in. scale length makes forming chords a breeze yet gives the instrument plenty of snap and tuning stability for a rewarding playing experience. The acoustic-electric versions, like this GS Mini-e Koa Acoustic-Electric, come with Taylor's reliable ES-B electronics. All GS-Mini models include a durable hard bag built by Taylor for the optimal fit.\n\nTonewoods\nA guitar's top is the primary filter and distributor of vibrating string energy through the guitar, which means it has a huge impact on its sound. The GS Mini-E Koa features solid Hawaiian Koa, a hardwood that produces a natural compression, yielding more of a controlled \"roll-in\" effect to a note. The compression evens out a lively attack for a more balanced response. It delivers strong fundamentals with clear and direct focus - similar to mahogany - but with extra top-end shimmer and chime. The arched back of the guitar generates more sound from a small- bodied instrument, and using layered wood back and sides create a sturdy yet receptive platform for the vibrating string energy sent by the guitar's top. Layered wood is also less succeptible to changes in temperature and humidity, making it an excellent choice for players who travel with their instruments or simply require more durability.\n\nElectronics\nThe GS Mini-e Koa is amplified via the Expression System Basic (ES-B) system, which incorporates piezo design elements from the flagship Taylor ES2 system. It's powered by an onboard preamp that includes a built-in digital chromatic tuner, an LED display for tuning and low battery indication, and Tone and Volume controls. The preamp/tuner is powered by two button cell 3v lithium (CR2032) batteries. Two new batteries will provide approximately 300 hours of use. The ES-B conserves battery life using a standard on/off system that will automatically turn off if left on over 3 minutes. A low battery indicator on the LED display (located on the preamp circuit board) will display an “L” when the battery reaches 4.5 volts.\n\nThe Taylor Difference\nWhat sets Taylor Guitars apart? Unmatched build quality, the most stable and playable necks, a vast array of tonal options, eco-conscious and ethically-sourced raw materials, and a lifetime of service and support.\n",

      "A truly special \"Special Edition\" instrument, this 414ce V-Class Grand Auditorium acoustic-electric features many custom elements artfully incorporated by Taylor Guitars' Master Guitar Designer, Andy Powers. Along with Taylor's innovative V-Class bracing, together, these features deliver much more than the sum of their parts. For everyone from pros to hobbyists, they make the playing experience more expressive, inspiring and fun. The volume, the sustain, the \"in-tune-ness\" of the instrument and its high-fidelity sonic detail combine to deliver a new level of player experience. Indian rosewood is one of the most popular and musically expressive tonewoods in the world, and paired with Sitka spruce produces a rich and detailed sound. Taylor's Grand Auditorium shape and rosewood's balanced, broad sonic range and complexity - and of course Taylor's renown playability - result in a guitar that will be a joy to play in a variety of scenarios for a lifetime.\n\nThe 414ce V-Class Special Edition Grand Auditorium instrument ships in a deluxe hardshell case made by Taylor for optimal fit and protection.\n\nGrand Auditorium\nA Taylor original, the Grand Auditorium helped establish the Taylor acoustic sound. The popular body style makes for a versatile guitar that yields ample volume in response to light fingerpicking, and reacts to medium strumming and flatpicking with a clear, balanced sound across the tonal spectrum. If you want a great all-purpose guitar, the GA is an excellent choice.\n\nTonewood Pairing\nA guitar's top is the primary filter and distributor of vibrating string energy through the guitar, which means it has a huge impact on its sound. Sitka Spruce is the most prevalent guitar top wood of the modern era. It blends stiffness and elasticity in just the right proportions which translates into broad dynamic range with crisp articulation. Solid Indian rosewood back and sides complement the Sitka top with sound that's made it one of the most popular tone woods ever. Rosewood produces the strongest bass response among the tone woods commonly used for guitars, with a slightly scooped midrange. Rosewood's sweeping frequency range - deep lows that assert a throaty growl with sparkling highs - rings out with bell-like, high-fidelity clarity. It yields a full-range acoustic voice with complex overtones and extended sustain.\n\nElectronics\nTaylor's ES2 is a revolutionary pickup design that delivers the latest in Taylor’s ongoing innovation in acoustic guitar amplification. The heart of the Expression System 2 is Taylor’s patented behind-the-saddle pickup, which features three uniquely positioned and individually calibrated pickup sensors. Because the pickup doesn't sit under the saddle, the bottom of the saddle comes in full contact with the bridge, allowing all the nuance of the guitar's tone to come through clearly whether playing acousticly or plugged-in. The location of the sensors enables a more dynamic range of acoustic sound to be captured than ever before while playing plugged-in. Together with Taylor’s custom-designed “professional audio”-grade preamp, this system produces exceptional amplified tone and responsiveness. On stage through a PA, plugged into your favorite acoustic amplifier, or direct into recording software, the Expression System 2 faithfully conveys the voice of your Taylor guitar. The Taylor Expression System 2 operates through a proprietary 9-volt battery compartment and easy-to-use volume, and active bass and treble controls. \n\nSpecial Features\nPremium features on this 414ce Special Edition Grand Auditorium include an abalone rosette, \"Engraved Victorian\" fretboard inlays with matching peghead inlay, Shaded Edge Burst (top), gold hardware, grained ivoroid binding and V-Class bracing. Taylor's V-Class bracing is a fundamental innovation in acoustic guitar design. It marks an important evolution beyond traditional X-bracing, introducing an entirely new platform for acoustic performance. It is essentially a \"sonic engine\" that optimizes the response of an acoustic guitar in three key ways: by boosting volume, sustain, and by largely resolving the intonation (in-tune-ness) issues that have long plagued acoustic guitars. V-Class bracing creates purer, more orderly notes that don't cancel each other out or sound \"off\". They have clearer, more consistent response, and the whole fretboard is brought into greater sonic alignment for a more musical playing/listening experience. Guitars with V-Class bracing are easier to tune; the pitch sounds purer and more solid, and electronic tuners can more easily locate notes for quick, precise tuning. Other benefits: harmonics ring more uniformly down the neck, notes are louder with more projection and sustain, and notes are more consistent, i.e., upper register notes don't get choked out or swallowed. Fewer \"sour\" sonic qualities exist with chords; a more agreeable relationship is created between notes as they ripen, bloom and decay.\n\nThe Taylor Difference\nWhat sets Taylor Guitars apart?

      "The Martin D-35 dreadnought acoustic guitar was birthed in the folk music boom of the 1960s. Designed in 1965, the D-35 was created because Martin was experiencing a shortage of rosewood wide enough to build their famous D-28. Known for its three-piece back, with a contrasting center wedge, the D-35 quickly caught on with musicians that preferred the cosmetic look of a three-piece back. Along with the cosmetic changes to the appearance, the D-35 offered a different sound and tone to the famous D-28.\n\nConstructed with 1/4” bracing, the D-35 had a slight bump in the bottom end when compared to the stiffer 5/16” bracing of the D-28. Over time players really began to latch on to the tonal variation, and as a result, the D-35 quickly became an industry standard among players and collectors alike.\n\nVintage Tone Meets Modern Playability\nToday, the D-35 Standard Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar has been refined to combine the best of the vintage 1930's appointments, with the playability of a modern guitar. Like the D-35 from the 1960s, the bracing is 1/4” in thickness, but the placement of the X brace has been forward-shifted to be located one inch from the soundhole. Now, the D-35 Standard has a very even bass, with just the right blend of the mid and high-end frequencies. The sound is everything you would expect from a fine-tuned Martin acoustic guitar.\n\nPlayability\nPlayability has been dramatically improved by changing the neck to a modified low oval, with a Performing Artist taper and 1-3/4” nut. The wider string spacing and comfortable neck profile allow a player to move up and down the neck with ease. And, unlike the more traditional feeling acoustic guitars of the past, newer D-35 Standard models will have familiar vintage tone with a playing feel that will be more similar to that of an electric guitar.\n\nOther Appointments\nAlong with an amazing sound and feel, this D-35 Standard Dreadnought acoustic features a solid Sitka spruce top, solid East Indian rosewood back and sides, ebony bridge and fingerboard, hand-fit dovetail neck joint, nitrocellulose lacquer, mother-of-pearl fingerboard inlay pattern, antique white binding, aging toner, and a bone nut and saddle.\n\nIncludes a hardshell case.\n\n",

      "Epiphone's Ltd. Ed. SG-Special-I is a great way for new players to get started on electric guitar at a price anyone can afford. The SG-Special-1 has the same classic “SG” tone, look and feel that’s gone virtually unchanged for over 50 years and players from all genres around the world recognize the “SG” as one of the best and most distinctive electric guitars ever made. But seasoned pros will also love the Ltd. Ed. SG Special-1 for its powerful ceramic open-coil humbuckers and smooth, easy-to-play mahogany SlimTaper neck. Plus, the Ltd. Ed. SG-Special-1 comes in three beautiful classic color finishes, Cherry, Ebony, and Pelham Blue.\n\nThe Ltd. Ed. SG Special-1 joins the fan-favorite Special-1 Series designed to bring superior sound and historic Epiphone-style to players just starting out, as well as to veterans who want a “workhorse” guitar to take on the road that’s lightweight but makes no compromise in electronics and hardware.\n \nThe “SG” profile is one of the most recognized in rock and roll. First introduced in the early 1960s, “SG” guitars have been the driving force behind heavy metal, hard rock, jam bands and British rock. And now with the Ltd. Ed. SG-Special-I, Epiphone fans around the world can enjoy owning and playing a real Epiphone “SG” at a great price. \n \nThe Ltd. Ed. SG Special-1 has a mahogany body cut to the historic SG profile and a bolt-on mahogany neck featuring the same SlimTaper profile enjoyed by owners of iconic Epiphones like the Les Paul Standard and the Casino. The mahogany neck's fingerboard has 22 easy-to-press medium-jumbo frets with pearloid dot inlays, just like vintage SGs. Even though new players might favor the Ltd. Ed. SG Special-1, this SG boasts many of the same specifications found on all SGs, including a 1.68” nut and 24.75” scale length.\n \nThis Ltd. Ed. SG Special-1 is powered by an Epiphone Ceramic 700TTM open-coil humbucker in the bridge or lead position and an Epiphone Ceramic 650RTM open-coil humbucker in the neck or rhythm position. Ceramic pickups have been a favorite of hard rock and metal players for decades. Ceramic magnets became more readily available in the late 60s and early 70s just as guitar players were incorporating overdrive and distortion into their sound. Ceramic pickups have a sharp, articulate and saturated tone that’s a perfect compliment to the SG Special-1’s mahogany body. Pickup selection is made via a standard 3-way pickup selector, and controls include Master Volume and Master Tone, both with classic Black “Speed” knobs. \n \nThe Ltd. Ed. SG-Special I has Epiphone’s world-renown rock-solid hardware, including a heavy-duty 1/4” jack, easy-turning machine heads with a pro 15:1 tuning ratio, and a classic wrap-around bridge and tailpiece compensated for reliable intonation. \n \n",

The material is then carved and finished in a conventional manner. The end result is a very strong neck that provides definition and articulate sustain from note to note.\n\nThe high-performance neck shape (25.4 in. scale, 1-3/4 in. nut width, and 16 in. radius) provides comfort and dexterity when performing intricate movements and progressions along the black Richlite fretboard.\n\nThis special X Series GPCX Grand Performance Acoustic-Electric Guitar is strung with Martin Authentic Acoustic – Lifespan 2.0 light gauge strings, and comes equipped with Fishman MX electronics.

      "The neck shape and 634mm scale length of the SLG200S continue the design legacy of conventional acoustic guitars, while its ultra-slim body is perfect for players of both acoustic and electric instruments.\n\nSound by SRT Powered\nSRT Powered is a new system designed to recreate the body resonance of an acoustic guitar in a bodiless guitar. Yamaha developed SRT Powered, collaborating with recording artists to create a system tailored to the unique properties of the new SLG body and modelled after the tones of a high-end Yamaha acoustic guitar captured using a carefully selected microphone in a professional recording studio environment. By actually reproducing the sound of an acoustic guitar—right down to its natural sustain and decay—Yamaha lets guitarists experience the genuine body resonance, body tone and ambience of an acoustic guitar.\n\nSRT Powered sound can even be mixed with the sound from the instrument's piezo pickups, allowing guitarists to be even more flexible in their creative endeavors. Because the SLG can virtually reproduce the sound of a guitar recorded with a microphone, players are free from complicated procedures involved in mic-ing up a guitar when recording at home or in other settings.\n\nFunctionality\nConnect to an external music player to enjoy music playback, enhance your playing with a range of authentic effects, or plug in headphones to enjoy playing in privacy—the SLG offers a variety of functions that make playing even more enjoyable. What's more, SLG come with a built-in precision chromatic tuner, compatibility with both battery- and AC power, and a range of other user-friendly features.",
